            <h1>Shell - Far Away</h1>
            <p>Far Away has been a timeline of sorts from the end of summer to early winter over my thoughts on my surroundings 
                as I came to terms with how far away they began to feel. I feel far away from myself in the year prior and far away from 
                the possibilities that next year brings. This distance has brought me closer to my memories of my identities over time. 
                It has allowed me to recognize how deeply I'm embedded in the places I exist in.</p>

            <p>Compiled over the course of four months, including ideas as old as six months ago. Recorded in my room, released January 1, 2022</p>
            <p>The Shell: acoustic guitar, electric guitar, keyboard, vocals, mandolin, harmonica, noise, mastering.</p>

            <h1>Shell - Far Away</h1>
            <p>Sodom and Gomorrah has been a timeline of sorts from early winter to the beginning of spring for my growing bitterness and 
                resentment towards those around me but also myself. I felt disillusioned by the authorities that had once governed my life 
                so strongly and by the deaf ears upon which I felt my attempts at communication could not be interpreted. I found myself 
                increasingly drawn towards the writings of mid-century alchemists and practitioners of hermetic art, where the clarity of 
                aural imagery over literary exposition occurred to me. So too did my understanding of the duality of early romanticists grow, 
                as the lines between religion, mysticism, and nature became blurred. This blurring obscures and reveals in oscillating motions 
                the underlying sublime: the throughline between the self and the rest of being. The bitterness that once drove me towards 
                catharsis pulled me instead towards the purging of sins and of the self, one that forced me to confront my own growth and paralysis. </p>

            <p>In seeking escape from the mundane via fantastical extrapolation and imagination, we grow further from the sublime. 
                Rather, by focusing directly upon the mundane and seeing through the veil by dissolution of category and of distinction, 
                it is revealed that suffering is temporary. </p>

            <pre>
                “The unnameable is the eternally real.
                Naming is the origin 
                Of all particular things.

                Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
                Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

                Yet mystery and manifestations
                Arise from the same source.
                This source is called darkness.

                Darkness within darkness,
                The gateway to all understanding.”
